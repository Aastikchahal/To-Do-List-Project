# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To-Do List Application

A simple and responsive To-Do List application built using **React** and **Vite**. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This project demonstrates the use of functional components, hooks, state management, and props in React.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Edit tasks**: Edit any task in the list.
- **Mark as completed**: Mark tasks as completed and strike them through visually.
- **Delete tasks**: Delete tasks from the list.
- **Real-time updates**: The list updates dynamically as users interact with it.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is styled to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
